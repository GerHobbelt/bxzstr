# bxzstr â€” A C++ ZLib / libBZ2 / libLZMA wrapper

Header-only library for using standard c++ iostreams to access streams
compressed with ZLib, libBZ2, or liblzma (.gz, .bz2, and .xz files).

For decompression, the format is automatically detected. For
compression, the only parameter exposed is the compression algorithm.

The core functionality of this library is largely based on the
[zstr](https://github.com/mateidavid/zstr) library by [Matei
David](https://github.com/mateidavid).

## Input detection

The library automatically detects whether the input stream is
compressed or not, and with which algorithm. The detection is based on
identifying the headers based on the magic numbers:
* GZip header, starting with **1F 8B**
* ZLib header, starting with **78 01**, **78 9c**, and **78 DA**
* BZ2 header, starting with **42 5a 68**
* LZMA header, starting with **FD 37 7A 58 5A 00**

when no header is identified, the strema is treated as plain text (uncompressed).

## Usage
The streams can be accessed through 6 classes that function similarly
to their standard library counterparts

* `bxz::istreambuf` is the core decompression class.
* `bxz::ostreambuf` is the core compression class.
* `bxz::istream` is a wrapper for the `bxz::istreambuf` class.
* `bxz::ostream` is a wrapper for the `bxz::ostreambuf` class.
* `bxz::ifstream` is a wrapper for the `bxz::istreambuf` class that
  can be used to open a file and read decompressed data from it.
* `bxz::ofstream` is a wrapper for the `bxz::ostreambuf` class that
  can be used to write compressed data to a file.

For the classes derived from `bxz::ostreambuf`, the compression
algorithm must be specified as the second argument:
```
bxz::ofstream("filename", bxz::z);
bxz::ostream(std::cin, bxz::bz2);
bxz::ostreambuf(std::cin.rdbuf(), bxz::lzma);
```

If the stream objects fail at any point, `failbit` exception mask
will be turned on.

## Requirements and dependencies
* Compiler with c++11 support
* libz, libbz2, and liblzma

You can use the library without one of libz, libbz2, or liblzma by
commenting out the relevant parts in `compression_types.hpp`.
